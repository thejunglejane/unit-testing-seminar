# Unit 1: Unit Testing How-To

In this unit we'll cover how to write unit tests in more detail, including how
to test Jupyter notebooks versus Python modules, and how to determine what tests
you need to write.

You can practice writing unit tests on your own Jupyter notebooks and/or Python
modules, or you can practice writing unit tests on the notebooks and modules
included in this unit.
